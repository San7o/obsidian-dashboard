# obsidian-dashboard

The goal of this project is to build a plugin that displays a customizable dashboard,
composed of multiple graphical cards. The plugin can interface with online APIs to fetch data for the cards, enabling numerous possibilities. Example cards include:

- to-do list

- weather

- news

- goals

- stocks

- ...


## Current state

Currently, the plugin is in early developement and lacks essential features. I will accept
contributions once the plugin is in a more ready state.

# Developement

You need `npm` instaled, then run the commands:
```bash
npm install --save-dev
npm run dev
```
